# Rascal Clone Detector
A clone detector written in Rascal. It uses the abstract syntax tree generated by Rascal to detect the clones. The detection algorithm was based on the Basic Subtree Clone Detection Algorithm from the paper [Clone Detection Using Abstract Syntax Trees](http://www.bauhaus-stuttgart.de/clones/CloneDR_ICSM98_IEEE_Copyright.pdf) by Ira D. Baxter, Andrew Yahin, Leonardo Moura, Marcelo Santâ€™Anna, and Lorraine B.
